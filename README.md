# TFG Chess Engine
This is my final course project for the Computer Science degree at Tecnocampus University. I have developed a Chess Engine using AI architectures, including Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and the implementation of an evaluation function to determine the best moves.

In this project you can find all the files I created to achieve the goal of making a chess engine, in case you want to test the game, there is a .rar file containing the build of the game "build.rar". 

## Steps to play the game

1.- Download the "build.rar" file.
2.- Extract it on your computer, on the desktop or wherever you want. 
3.- Click the folder "build", then "chess_engine" and then click on the "chess_engine.exe". (In this step, when clicking the chess_engine.exe, there may be some problems with the Windows Firewall (if you are playing it on Windows) or with the firewall you have installed, the file is 100% safe but the computer may think it can be harmfull).
4.- Inside the application, you can either play vs the AI (the first icon) or vs another human using the same computer (not online). You can also resize the window using the buttons on the bottom. (This is mainly because the cross on the top right is useful to log out of the chess game and depending on the resolution of the computer or the screen size, it may have some problems, I recommend to make sure you can see all the window).
5.- If you choose the first icon, you will be in a new screen where you can select the color you want to play (white or black) and the difficulty of the AI (0 to 4), each number will augment the number of iterations the AI will do on the minimax (the depth of the tree), so choosing a higher number will make the AI take more time to answer and use a move.
6.- When the difficulty and the color has been choosen, you can press the horse/knight icon on the bottom of the screen to start playing the game.

### Disclaimer
I apologize for any bugs in the game that may affect the gaming experience. I did my best given the time constraints, but I didn't have sufficient time for thorough playtesting and bug fixing.
